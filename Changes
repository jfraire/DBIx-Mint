Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Mint

0.05    - Fixed POD for DBIx::Mint::Schema. fields_not_in_db
	  was documented as not_in_db. Thanks to Alexey Vavilkin.

0.04
	- Added support for simultaneus database connections
	  and different schemas.

0.03 2013-06-04
	- Removed use of given/when construct as it is now
	  marked as 'experimental' in Perl 5.17 and upwards
	- In DBIx::Mint::Schema, add_relationship checks the 
	  validity of parameter result_as. The documentation
	  and tests were updated, since the option 'result_set'
	  should have been 'resultset' instead.

0.02  2013-06-02
	- Added DBIx::Connector
	- DBIx::Mint now establishes the database connection
	  directly, and it will not accept the database handle
	  as it did before.
