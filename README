DBIx-Mint
=========

Yet another object-relational mapping module for Perl. Its goals are:

* To provide flexible, chaineable methods to fetch data from a database
* To provide a flexible, powerful way to build relationships between classes
* It does not generate accessors, so you can use it on top of your existing classes
* To be light on dependencies

On the other side of the equation, it has some strong restrictions and drawbacks:

* It supports a single database handle
* While it uses roles (through Role::Tiny), it does put a lot of methods on your namespace
* It only uses DBI for the database connection and it makes no effort to keep it alive for long-running processes. You should take care of this in a persistent environment.

There are many ORMs for Perl. Most notably, you should look at DBIx::Class and DBIx::DataModel. DBIx::Lite is a light-weight alternative to those two mature, enterprise-level ORMs.

Note that this is a new distribution, and it is likely to change.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

* Perl version 5.10 or higher (to use given/when constructs and smart matching for array comparisons)
* DBI
* Moo
* SQL::Abstract::More
* Role::Tiny (a dependency of Moo, anyway)

* Clone

For testing, the following non-core modules are also used. These are not required:
