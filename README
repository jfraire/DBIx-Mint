NAME
       DBIx::Mint - Yet another light-weight ORM for Perl

VERSION
       This documentation refers to DBIx::Mint 0.01

SYNOPSIS
       Define your classes, which will play the role DBIx::Mint::Table:

        package Bloodbowl::Team;
        use Moo;
        with 'DBIx::Mint::Table';

        has id   => (is => 'rw' );
        has name => (is => 'rw' );
        ...

       Nearby (probably in a module of its own), you define the schema for
       your classes:
        package Bloodbowl::Schema;

        my $schema = DBIx::Mint->instance->schema;
        $schema->add_class(
            class      => 'Bloodbowl::Team',
            table      => 'teams',
            pk         => 'id',
            auto_pk => 1,
        );

        $schema->add_class(
            class      => 'Bloodbowl::Player',
            table      => 'players',
            pk         => 'id',
            is_auto_pk => 1,
        );

        # This is a one-to-many relationship
        $schema->one_to_many(
            conditions     => 
               ['Bloodbowl::Team', { id => 'team'}, 'Bloodbowl::Player'],
            method         => 'get_players',
            inverse_method => 'get_team',
        );

       And in your your scripts:

        use DBIx::Mint;
        use My::Schema;
        use DBI;

        # Connect to the database
        my $dbh  = DBI->connect(...);
        my $mint = DBIx::Mint->instance( dbh => $dbh );

        my $team    = Bloodbowl::Team->find(1);
        my @players = $team->get_players;

        # Database modification methods include insert, update, and delete.
        # They act on a single object when called as instance methods
        # but over the whole table if called as class methods:
        $team->name('Los Invencibles');
        $team->update;
        
        Bloodbowl::Coach->update(
           { status   => 'suspended' },
           { password => 'blocked'   });

       To find the documentation you need to set the schema and data
       modification methods, look into DBIx::Mint::Schema and
       DBIx::Mint::Table.

       Without a schema you can only fetch data. No data modification methods
       are offered. We have chainable methods for this:

        my $rs = DBIx::Mint::ResultSet->new( table => 'coaches' );

        # Joins. This will retrieve all the players for coach #1
        my @team_players = $rs->search( { 'me.id' => 1 } )
          ->inner_join( 'teams',   { 'me.id'    => 'coach' })
          ->inner_join( 'players', { 'teams.id' => 'team'  })
          ->all;

       See the docs for DBIx::Mint::ResultSet for all the methods you can use
       to retrieve data. Internally, relationships are declared in terms of
       ResultSet objects.

DESCRIPTION
       DBIx::Mint is yet another object-relational mapping module for Perl.
       Its goals are:

       ·   To be simple to understand and use

       ·   To provide flexible, chaineable methods to fetch data from a
           database

       ·   To provide a flexible, powerful way to build relationships between
           classes

       ·   To play nice with your Moo classes (although we do treat your
           objects as hash references under the hood)

       ·   To be light on dependencies

       On the other side of the equation, it has some strong restrictions:

       ·   It supports a single database handle

       ·   While it uses roles (through Role::Tiny/Moo::Role), it does put a
           lot of methods on your namespace. See DBIx::Mint::Table for the
           list. DBIx::Mint::ResultSet does not mess with your namespace at
           all.

       ·   It only uses DBI for the database connection and it makes no effort
           to keep it alive for long-running processes.

       There are many ORMs for Perl. Most notably, you should look at
       DBIx::Class and DBIx::DataModel. DBIx::Lite is a light-weight
       alternative to those two, enterprise-level ORMs.

       This module is in its infancy and it is very likely to change and
       (gasp) risk is high that it will go unmaintained.
